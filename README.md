## Overview of Project

We now know the breakdown of rider types in New York City, which will help us predict the customer breakdown in Des Moines and, in turn, propose a business model to investors. We know this by the first round of analysis we did [BikeSharing](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jovani.pink#!/vizhome/BikeSharing_16039941514670/NYCCitiBikeDashboard?publish=yes)

## Summary

We pulled Citi Bike's data and with Tableau and started asking questions of the data and asked questions of what information should we convey to investors.

You've answered two questions about the data using Tableau: (1) what is the breakdown of annual subscribers vs. short-term customers, and (2) what are the peak hours for bike rentals? These answers will help you broker a strategic conversation with investors.
